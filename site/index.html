  <p>This is a really simple web service that allows you to set up an
  RSS feed to remind you to do things.</p>

  <p>No account is required; you can just <a href="edit.cgi">create a
  feed</a> to get started!</p>

  <p>You can also <a
  href="https://github.com/plaidfluff/Reminder-Me">fork me on
  GitHub</a>, and if you have any problems, feel free to <a
  href="https://github.com/plaidfluff/Reminder-Me/issues">report a bug</a>.</p>

<h1>Detailed Usage</h1>

<div>

<p>Let's say that you have set reminders for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean the cat box (every 2 days)</li>
<li>Water the plants (daily)</li>
<li>Clean out the ice maker (every 2 weeks)</li>
<li>Update my financial planning spreadsheet (every month)</li>
</ul>

<p>Reminder Me generates one feed for each of those tasks. Whenever a
task becomes due, it places an item for that task into the feed.
There that item sits, until you click on the link that marks it as
being done, at which point a new due date is computed that tries to
keep the activity more or less regular.</p>

<p>But it's a bit smarter than just generating a single RSS item. The
item also has a little tracking image in it, which will bump the feed
item's GUID every time it's viewed.  This way, if you see an item but
just ignore it, the next time the feed reader checks the feed, it
gives me a new notification in the RSS inbox.</p>

<p>The ideal use case for Reminder Me is if you tend to check your RSS
feeds religiously and either maintain "inbox zero" (as I do) or put
some sort of high-priority display on important feeds. Obviously if
you let items sit in your inbox for years, this won't do you much good
(but you might want to reevaluate what RSS is meant for in that
case).</p>
